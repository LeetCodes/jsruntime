jsruntime
=========

This is a [Google Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/js-runtime-inspector/iilpjebedgohcmlffhnkhbjhabkdhfmn ) to explore javascript runtime.

It allows developers to explore javascript objects graph in memory. You can search objects by property names or values.

Be careful though - it uses regex to find properties. You can easily hang your browser if your object model is large.
